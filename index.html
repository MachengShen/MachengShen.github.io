            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Principal Investigator at the Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute. I received my Ph.D. from the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Jonathan P. How. During my doctoral studies,
                my research focused on reinforcement learning, robotic perception, and autonomous driving.
            </p>
            <p>
                During and after my Ph.D., I served as a machine learning researcher at Meta Reality Lab and several
                startup companies in the autonomous driving and robotics sectors. In late 2023, I joined the Qi Zhi
                Institute full-time, where my research centers on embodied intelligence, with a particular focus on
                developing simple, unified, and principled algorithms for general embodied intelligence.

            <p>
                My research aims to advance embodied intelligence by developing simple and principled approaches that
                are scalable and generalizable to various embodied AI tasks and domains.

                <h3>1) Neural SDEs as a Unified Approach to Continuous-Domain Sequence Modeling</h3>
                <p>
                    We are developing a novel approach to modeling continuous sequence dynamics using Neural Stochastic
                    Differential Equations (SDEs). Inspired by the use of differential equations in science and
                    engineering, this framework treats time-series data as samples from an underlying continuous system.
                    By parameterizing the drift and diffusion terms with neural networks, we ensure scalability and
                    adaptability. A key innovation is incorporating intrinsic uncertainty directly into the model,
                    making it robust to scaling across different data modalities. This approach is showing promise
                    across diverse tasks in embodied and generative AI, offering both simplicity and flexibility.

                <h3>2) Denoising-based Contractive Imitation Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    We are addressing the challenge of covariate shift in imitation learning through a simple yet
                    powerful denoising mechanism. Our method leverages a dual-network design: a dynamics model predicts
                    transitions, while a denoising policy network refines these predictions and guides actions. By
                    enhancing stability and contraction properties in state transitions, our approach reduces reliance
                    on additional expert data or complex adversarial setups. This work is paving the way for more robust
                    imitation learning systems that thrive even under noise and perturbations.
