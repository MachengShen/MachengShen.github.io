            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Principal Investigator at the Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute. I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Professor Jonathan P. How. During my doctoral studies,
                my research focused on reinforcement learning, robotic perception, and autonomous driving.
            </p>
            <p>
                During and after completing my Ph.D., I served as a machine learning research scientist/intern at Meta
                Reality Lab, Pony.ai, and Dexterity AI. Motivated by a desire to understand the essence of general
                intelligence and inspired by the groundbreaking advancements showcased by foundation models, I decided
                to return to academia. In late 2023, I joined the Qi Zhi Institute full-time, where my research centers
                on embodied intelligence, with a particular focus on developing simple, unified, and principled
                algorithms for general embodied intelligence.

                <h3>1) Neural SDEs as a Unified Approach to Continuous-Domain Sequence Modeling 
                    <span class="submission-info">(ongoing work, submitting to ICML 2025)</span>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are developing a novel framework for modeling continuous-time sequence dynamics based on Neural
                    Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Unlike previous methods that rely on virtual or artificial
                    time parametersâ€”such as diffusion models or flow-matching approachesâ€”our technique directly learns
                    an SDE governing the natural temporal evolution of the data. By parameterizing both the drift and
                    diffusion terms with neural networks, we introduce intrinsic uncertainty handling and enable a
                    single model to scale seamlessly across diverse modalities. Despite its conceptual simplicity, our
                    approach achieves competitive generative performance while operating orders of magnitude more
                    efficiently than standard diffusion- and flow-based models. This blend of theoretical elegance and
                    practical effectiveness makes Neural SDEs a compelling new direction for embodied and generative AI.

                <h3>2) Denoising-based Contractive Imitation Learning 
                    <span class="submission-info">(ongoing work, submitting to ICML 2025)</span>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We propose a novel imitation learning strategy that uses a denoising score function not just for
                    distributional modeling, as in diffusion models, but as a powerful tool for inducing contraction in
                    state transitions. This is achieved through a dual-network design: a dynamics model predicts future
                    states, while a denoising policy network refines these predictions to guide action selection. By
                    leveraging the denoising mechanism as a contraction enhancement strategy, our approach inherently
                    stabilizes the rollout trajectory and combats covariate-shift, without dependency on additional
                    expert data or adversarial
                    training. This innovation paves the way for more robust imitation learning systems capable of
                    withstanding noise and disturbances in real-world scenarios.
